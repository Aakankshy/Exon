## Background

I was introduced to D&D in August of 2020 by a close friend of mine. I was intrigued but inexperienced. I created my first character and our group of newbies started in the Forgotten Realms.

There was something magical about the experience that kept me coming back. For the first time in a very long time I had found a hobby that was going to stick.

But an aspect of the experience we struggled a bit with was delving deep into the world's lore. The Forgotten Realms was intimidating and the lore felt so distributed that my obsession with historical accuracy was going wild.

Watching my friend DM for our group, I knew that I wanted to try it too. But I wasn't sure if I was up for the intense amounts of research I would need to do to make it perfect.

So I made my own setting. It started off with just a single nation: Phantasmagoria. I fleshed out some basic ideas and details on each of the cities in the nation and thought that that would be the end of it.

Flash forward a few years and one-shots and now we have this. Exon. A setting made not just by myself but also the friends I started off playing D&D with and a number of others that gradually joined in.
