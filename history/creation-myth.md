## Epochs

The history of the plane is split by <em>Epochs</em>. Each Epoch marks a different paradigm in Exon and the <strong>Sphere of the Ancients</strong> as a whole. The start of each Epoch is generally marked by large, plane-changing events.

The "present time" is currently in Epoch 4.

### Epoch 1 - Creation

This Epoch lasted for an indeterminable amount of time. It began with the formation of the Sphere of the Ancients. At the time, nothing material truly existed within this space for this entire Epoch. There were no deities, no celestial bodies, and no living creatures.

All that existed was raw, unfiltered energy.

Divinators and arcanists believe that this energy was a mixture of radiation and the very energy that forms the basis of spellcasting today. It was chaotic; disordered; hungry. The Sphere of the Ancients tried to expand beyond its boundaries and corrupt the entirety of the prime material plane with its latent potential.

However, this expanding pressure was no match for the constricting pressure applied onto the space by the rest of the prime material plane. It was compressed until the overflowing energy had no choice but to be condensed into form; order.

This marked the end of Epoch 1 and gave way to Epoch 2: when order first came to be.

### Epoch 2 - Order

First came the [Ancient Ones]({{ site.baseurl }}/history/pantheon/ancient-ones). They were composed of the excess energy plaguing the space and the plane’s natural desire for order balanced their intentions--ensuring that each would keep the others in check.

The Council of the Ancients formed and their endless discourse began. Locked into place as they have always been, they discussed what they wanted to do and where they wanted to go next.

Another indeterminable amount of time passed; during this time, the Sphere was silent; motionless; calm. After millennia, the Ancient Ones decided that their energies were being wasted and that an eternity of this would be anything but preferable.

They agreed that the raw energy that composed them and their powers had to be given more concrete form. But they also understood that they could not be the ones to introduce it to the plane.

It had to be by proxy; a system that would allow the others to oversee change as it occurred. A system that would allow the others to prevent the misuse of power.

Thus came to be the first pantheon of [Central Deities]({{ site.baseurl }}/history/pantheon/central-deities).

### Epoch 3 - Society

It is unknown if the Central Deities from the beginning of Epoch 3 are the same as the ones known today. However, it is theorized that this pantheon immediately began to siphon their Ancient Ones’ powers and convert it to material and motion.

They created stars, planets, life, and oversaw the natural growth of this region of the prime material plane. This Epoch did not last as long as the first two by any means. However, it was still a considerable amount of time.

As life in the Sphere of the Ancients began to evolve and prosper, the Central Deities watched and occasionally hastened this process directly. The Ancient Ones continued to monitor the Central Deities to ensure that they did not get too heavily involved but they were more negligent back then.

Millions of years of evolution was compacted into thousands. Divinators approximate this period to have been anywhere between 6000 and 8000 years. While the denizens of the plane were not adversely affected, this artificial approach to the development of the Sphere was upsetting for some deities.

The Chaotic Good tether to [The Everkeep]({{ site.baseurl }}/history/pantheon/ancient-ones/taliama) was one such example. She was the predecessor to [Tygfrea]({{ site.baseurl }}/history/pantheon/central-deities/tygfrea) and is theorized to have been a triplet alongside [Evleen]({{ site.baseurl }}/history/pantheon/central-deities/evleen) and [Amarak]({{ site.baseurl }}/history/pantheon/central-deities/amarak). She was entirely against the idea of allowing Central Deities to interfere with the natural flow.

In complete contrast, the Neutral Evil tether to [The Archfright]({{ site.baseurl }}/history/pantheon/ancient-ones/ossium) (and predecessor to [Nalastzar]({{ site.baseurl }}/history/pantheon/central-deities/nalastzar)) was obsessed with maximizing its authority over this portion of the prime material plane. The Ancient Ones took notice of their conflict but were locked into inaction through their debates.

Instead, they merely watched under the misconception that this too was part of the natural progression of the Sphere.

The tension gradually rose over time. Other deities began to step in. Some chose to try and put an end to the conflict and prevent drastic action. Others picked sides and only intensified it. The situation persisted for the majority of this Epoch until, finally, the Neutral Evil tether of Ossium made its first and last move: the creation of a tether by a Central Deity.

The first Avatar.

It acted quickly; sending its Avatar to the material plane to invade Exon as well as numerous other worlds with a tremendous amount of its power being dedicated to this cause. By the time the Chaotic Good tether of Taliama stepped in, considerable damage had already been done.

The extraplanar boundaries within the Sphere had been damaged; planes like the Shadowfell began to seep into the prime material plane. Soon, rifts could begin to open and elemental chaos from the Elemental Planes could begin to plague the material plane as well.

The predecessor to Tygfrea decided that she had to put an end to it seeing as how nobody else was up to the task. She cast aside her sisters (who both tried to stop her) and invaded the prime material plane in a fit of unbecoming rage.

The predecessor to Nalastzar transferred all of its divine energy to its Avatar; it took over its form and infringed upon the sanctioned expanses of the prime material plane seeking a battle to end things once and for all.

The battle between them was fierce and lasted less than what had come to be known as a month. Most of their battle could not be perceived save for a few explosive showers of light that would inexplicably and only occasionally take over the night sky.

The Ancient Ones continued to spectate unsure (for the first time in millennia) of what to do. They merely watched alongside their other tethers as these deities battled until there was nothing left.

With one final blow and exertion of all of the power they could muster, the entire Sphere of the Ancients was vaporized including all life, matter, as well as Central Deities.

All that remained was a vacuous void at the epicenter of the Sphere known as <strong>[Vix]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/vix)</strong>. A void placed at the exact position that the battling deities traded their final blows. A void birthed by the overconsumption of the Sphere’s energy.

The Ancient Ones witnessed this with an overwhelming sense of regret and mournfulness. Both Taliama and Ossium were left in a weakened state after losing a considerable amount of power to their insubordinate tethers.

It was then that, for the first time in a very long time, they overcame their impasse and decided that they had to intervene. This was their fault. This was their negligence.

Despite their differences, they could at least agree on one thing: they did not want their Sphere to be empty. They passed a vote to undo this tragedy even if it meant interfering. This was the only exception that they were ever going to make.

### Epoch 4 - Rebirth

The Council of the Ancients pooled together their divine energy to Taliama knowing that she was the only one that could rewind history to prevent this disaster from ever having occurred.

Taliama’s weakened state was rectified. In fact, her depiction and form was strengthened beyond that of the other Ancient Ones. For just this moment in history, she ascended beyond the capabilities of even an Ancient One.

Some theologists refer to this hypothetical form as that of an <strong>Architect</strong>.

Taliama concentrated the combined power of the Ancients and played a yearlong solo with her stringed instrument. <em>The Cry of the Ancients</em>.

With every note, history was reversed and rewritten and at the end of her piece, she returned to her position as a member of the Council and witnessed (alongside the others) the universe reborn.

Yet the one thing that even she could not erase entirely was Vix which remained as a reminder to the Ancient Ones what could happen if their powers were misused.

The world returned to normal as though it had never been erased and it was only after astronomers caught sight of the inexplicable, new celestial body in the sky that the world began to realize that something was off.

The most skilled of divinators and mages got together to combine their powers and determine the nature of what looked to be a black dot the size of the moon surrounded by a thin, purple ring in the sky. It seemed to follow a daily cycle similar to the Sun but they knew that it was different, somehow.

Bigger.

Their efforts resulted in the discovery of clues that served as the basis of the hypothesis of how the eventful climax to Epoch 3 really happened. They had witnessed the beginning of a new era: Epoch 4.

The Ancient Ones reformed the pantheon of Central Deities. They reconstructed the deities that had acted out of line as Tygfrea and Nalastzar.

Ossium continued to exist in a weakened state while Taliama retained some of the power she had been given from the Council and took her place in the group as the strongest Ancient One.
