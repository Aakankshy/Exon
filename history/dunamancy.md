## Time & Space
The school of Dunamancy was not naturally discovered or created in this world. The records say that it was instead brought to Exon by a traveler from another world.

A powerful yet nameless archmage that is now known posthumously as <strong>Temploc</strong>.

Temploc reportedly arrived in Exon in E4-696 and disappeared 4 years later in E4-700 at the turn of the century. Most theorize that they either returned to their world of origin or suffered a more unfortunate fate.

But 4 years was enough for Temploc to pass their knowledge of this school of magic on to this world.

## Disciple
Temploc was not the one that divulged their knowledge to the world on a large scale. They instead entrusted it to a single disciple: <strong>Sumaz Despina</strong>.

Sumaz Despina was the only pupil that Temploc took in and taught directly. Despite her youth, they could see latent talent within her.

With her magical affinity and teacher's legacy, she represents the School of Dunamancy in the [Protelian Union]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/global-orgs/protelian-union).
