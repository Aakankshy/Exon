## The Ancient Ones

The Ancient Ones are akin to Elder Gods. They are the oldest beings known to exist—some having existed before time itself. As such, they have grown to be some of the most powerful entities to date.

Their disciplines and domains tend to be more abstract concepts and/or other immutable properties of the realms such as time or chaos.

There are only five of these entities—each representing a different alignment. Records theorize that rather than being created by any single entity, the Ancient Ones were birthed by the universe’s natural desire for order and balance.

They are by no means the most amiable towards one another. However, being the most powerful beings in the Outer Planes, they coexist in relative peace.

## The Council of the Ancients

The Ancient Ones are depicted as a group coexisting as a <em>council</em>. They determine the course of the universe and all of the planes by vote and they have done so for all of time.

However, each of the Ancient Ones represents the polar opposite to another; where one may vote in favor of a course of action, there will always be another voting against it. It is because of this that the ongoing debate among the Ancient Ones exists as a perpetual stalemate representing the maintenance of order.

The only exception to this is Just: The Fool. Being the representative of true neutrality, they behave as an arbiter to the Ancient Ones' eternal debate. They veto any drastic courses of action and are in charge of ensuring that there is no foul play involved behind the scenes of the debate.

## Tethers
Each of the Ancient Ones acts as a source of untapped divine energy that exists without form. <strong><em>Tethers</em></strong> are the Central Deities that are tied to each of the Ancient Ones.

Most Ancient Ones possess three tethers; each delegated to an alignment adjacent to their own. The Ancient Ones are held responsible by the council for the actions of any of their tethers.

As such, misbehavior by tethers is frowned upon and on the rare occasions where it does happen, tethers have their existences dismantled by the remaining Ancient Ones to be reconstructed once more.

When this happens, history itself is rewritten to account for these changes and the previous identities of the dismantled tethers are unknown to the flow of time.

The raw energy from each of the Ancient Ones is passed down to their tethers to be given coherent form; to be utilized for fueling the spread of their respective teachings.

While the tenets of the Central Deities may not abide precisely by the tenets of their tethered Ancient Ones, they are often similar in nature and approached from similar perspectives; they are, after all, facets of their creators in a wider sense.
