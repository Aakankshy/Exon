## The Central Deities

The Central Deities serve as amplifiers for the divine power of Ancient Ones they are tethered to.

They are much younger in comparison to the Ancient Ones. Their actions and disciplines are generally attributed to be extensions to the wills of their creators.

The domains of the Central Deities are generally more specific than those of the Ancient Ones and more commonplace as far as worship goes. Their tenets build off of the teachings of their tethers but often hone in on specific details based on their alignments and such.

## Interference with the Planes

The Central Deities are barred from interfering with any of the inner planes.

While each of the Ancient Ones hope to enable their tethers mobilize and carry out their wills, the combined pressure from the other four prevents it.

However, to some degree, Central Deities are allowed to be involved with the inner planes more intimately than the Ancient Ones. Namely, they are allowed to siphon divine energy from their creators and give it form and pass it along to their disciples.

This is one of the three cases in which Central Deities are allowed to intervene. The second case is when other Central Deities have either gone rogue or overstepped their boundaries; in these cases Central Deities are given clearance by the Council of the Ancients to step in and put an end to it.

The final case for interference with the inner planes is through <em><strong>Avatars</strong></em>.

## Avatars

Avatars are fragments of the divine energy that constitutes the forms of the Central Deities. They are much weaker and often take simpler, less potent forms.

Many take humanoid forms to blend in with the denizens of the inner planes. Others take a simplified version of the most widespread depictions of their tethered Central Deities.

Avatars are like pawns or empty vessels that are directly controlled by deities that may traverse along the inner planes freely. While their powers are still far beyond those of mortals, scarce interference by them is tolerated by the Ancient Ones; they are less capable of causing calamity.

The Central Deities are thus allowed to carry out their creators' teachings directly but within reason. Central Deities (based on the orders given to them) often abuse this right to test the boundaries of what is possible and what is not.

For this reason, it is very common for Avatars to be reconstructed from scratch. In rarer cases, should their insolence cross too many boundaries, the Central Deities in control of them have also been unmade as a result.

Most Avatars spectate the state of the inner planes more intimately and allow the Ancient Ones to observe them by proxy as well. Each Avatar is often given its own personality and such, allowing the Ancient Ones to view the inner planes with more bias and through a variety of lenses.

Occasionally, Avatars are also given charge of situations where other Avatars have been independently getting out of line. This allows dire situations to be nipped in the bud and prevents the need for Central Deities and/or Avatars from having to be remade as frequently.
