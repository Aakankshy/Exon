## Introduction

The custom deities in Exon are split into two categories: Ancient Ones and Central Deities.

There are a total of five Ancient Ones while there are numerous other Central Deities. The Ancient Ones are beings that are incomprehensibly old and also the creators of their associated Central Deities.

Central Deities are younger, feebler beings in comparison to their creators. Their existences and powers are inherently tethered to the Ancient Ones that created them.

While the Ancient Ones are omnipotent, in the face of the infinite expanse of the prime material plane, even their reach falls short; they have dominion over Exon and the worlds near it but their influence wanes the farther you go from it.

Theologians and conjurers specializing in interplanar magic call their zone of influence the <strong>Sphere of the Ancients</strong>.

## Layers of Worship

While the Ancient Ones serve as the sources of divine magical energy, their the Central Deities tethered to them (also known as their <strong><em>tethers</em></strong>) are the ones that actually grant those powers to acolytes.

Most worshipers of the Ancient Ones gradually filter into their tethers based on the interests, alignments, and disciplines that suit them best.

While some acolytes choose to remain less confined and worship Ancient Ones directly, almost all practitioners of divine magic filter into worshiping specific Central Deities.

The only exceptions to this are mentioned in very few records that suggest there may have been individuals that had received the direct blessing of the Ancient Ones themselves.

However, these exceptional cases have been lost to time and it is unclear whether these tales had been spun from truth or speculation.
