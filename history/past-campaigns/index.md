## A "Personal" Archive
Stepping out of the writer's shoes for a moment, I'd like to clarify what exactly the contents of this page are meant to be.

This page is an archive of brief summaries and lore details from all past campaigns that either I have run or been a part of with my own group.

The things contained here are just meant to help my group keep track of the events and other potentially world-changing decisions that we've made across our games.

They're not meant to define the canonical progression of the world for everyone; just us.

That said, there are some extra bits of lore that we have fleshed out specifically for the stories we have told. These may serve to inspire alternative approaches to the world and such so it might still be of interest to you.

## Caution
Most of the pages in this archive have been marked as spoilers; there may be additional notes that we made for these campaigns that were never uncovered or potential story hooks into stories we may want to tell in the future. Tread carefully!
