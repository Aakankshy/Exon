## Summary
Amidst a snowy wonderland by the name of Krymton, a band of mercenaries—each with their fair share of problems and motivations—come together on a mission to ruin the town’s festivities.

Hired by a mysterious recluse named Igrinx, their mission is to break into a cave system under the Krymton Red—a giant tree in the center of town—and set off several arcane bombs to destroy the presents stored within.

Presents that were going to be used for Krymton’s end of year festival. Seems simple enough. What could go wrong?

## Setting Details
This story was set a few months after the events of the [Marilith's Kiss]({{ site.baseurl }}/history/past-campaigns/krime-in-krymton) campaign at the end of E4-723. It took place in Krymton; a rural village in the Northern regions of the Snowdrift<!--TODO-->.

## Lore
By the end of the one-shot, Igrinx (who was the Avatar of [Nalastzar]({{ site.baseurl }}/history/pantheon/central-deities/nalastzar)) was punished by being eradicated and reconstructed from scratch as an entirely new entity.

Igrinx exists once more—just not in the same way and form as before. Additionally, Krymton was restored to its original state by the Avatars of both [The Fool]({{ site.baseurl }}/history/pantheon/central-deities/the-fool) and [Samateer]({{ site.baseurl }}/history/pantheon/central-deities/samateer) (named "Fool" and "Puella" respectively).

## Player Characters
- <strong>Falmorn</strong> - continuing to work with the cult of Nalastzar to further his own goals, he gradually began to back out of the group over time after the events of this day. For the foreseeable future, he'll try to isolate himself from society and just take it easy on his own.
- <strong>Iris</strong> - she continued her travels around Mith’lon following the liberation of Saccharo. She still has the 'Matron’s Eyes' in her possession (a relic owned by the Matron originally running the Marilith’s Kiss prior to their liberation).
- <strong>Kermit the Kracked</strong> - he went back to Lux to report his findings in Krymton to the [Fingers of the Fool]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/global-orgs/bmc). He continues, now, to work as an inquisitor-in-training for them.
- <strong>Tenebris von Haagen</strong> - ran off to hide out in the murky depths of the forest of Aldorah<!--TODO-->.
- <strong>Velea</strong> - after realizing what she was doing and how many people her actions had hurt, she gave up on trying to get revenge on the Kla'as family. Instead, she worked with them in their efforts to remake all the toys they had lost in the battle. She was quickly accepted thanks to townsfolk like Beralt (the old man she met before her mission).
