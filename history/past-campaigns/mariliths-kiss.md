## Summary

Waking up after an intense night out, a haphazard band of washed-up adventurers finds itself in a magnificent dwelling.

Mirroring the kind of wonderland one could only dream of, the group meets and eventually begins to try to leave. However, they slowly begin to realize that not everything is sunshine and rainbows.

Realizing that their attempts to escape are futile and aided by the occasional (and, frankly, often deranged) ally/fellow ‘inmate’, they pass through a labyrinthine series of paths, rooms, and hallways—piecing together the mystery of what happened the night before, all the while.

## Setting Details

The events of this campaign took place in E4-723 in Saccharo, Phantasmagoria.

At the time of the campaign, Saccharo was plagued by an unknown, corrupting force. The previously beautiful plains were turned into a hideous, dangerous, and horrific space.

All creatures born in the plains were eternally trapped there and doomed to never feel anything but magical joy. Even the sun did not set. Gradually, the rifts between the prime material plane and the Feywild in the area began to worsen.

Creatures from beyond came to the world and continued to fuel the demented cycle of abnormal developments in Saccharo until the area was beyond recognition.

## Lore
The events of the Marilith’s Kiss involved putting an end to a giant, crystalline tumor that was the source of the corruption.

Once destroyed, the establishment returned to being a simple, abandoned mansion in the middle of nowhere and the city of Saccharo was restored to a more natural state.

The endless daytime was replaced by a natural daylight cycle, the denizens were granted freedom (to leave, to feel, and to lament). The endless number of ‘sugar-coated dangers’ began to undergo the process of gradually wilting.

Over the course of a year or so (a few months into E4-724), many of the creatures and people that had known nothing but the Kiss worked to reconstruct it. Within those months, "The Marilith's Kiss" reopened as “The Bombshell Bunker.”

The name was a silly but surprisingly appealing play on words; the establishment was built on the same site as a large bunker on the Southern front of the Two Fronts war.

After its reopening, the business (as well as the primary services being offered) returned to being the same as they used to be. The only difference was that it became significantly less sketchy and significantly more gaudy.

## Player Characters
- <strong>Anna Zimmerman</strong> - went back to the city of Aqua and continued living under the pretenses of being a “traveler from another world.” In reality, she was delusional and clinically insane and the events of the campaign didn't help.
- <strong>Hark “Crackshot” Neverforen</strong> - continued to live life as one of the most renowned mercenaries in the Luxian branch of the [Black Mark Company]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/global-orgs/bmc).
- <strong>Master Gao Wyo</strong> - went back to making and dealing drugs in Aqua and/or Saccharo. He continued to live like a ghost in the world. He began to slowly perfect the formula he had orignally found in a ditch somewhere... (note: this was a sample of the Dust of Lethargy that Horus (an NPC) from the [Two Fronts campaign]({{ site.baseurl }}/history/past-campaigns/two-fronts) had sold to Illorius that the latter had later carelessly disposed of).
- <strong>Touque “Tuck” Thimble</strong> - went back to studying dark magic in Saccharo, presumably. However, he does travel quite a bit so he’s the kind of guy that shows up whenever and wherever always with some kind of valid excuse.
- <strong>Zeedouss</strong> - died* doing what she loved: partying. (* Aaracockran folk die really early. Plus, she was an alcoholic so she kind of had it coming).

## Significant Non Player Characters
- <strong>Sir Chrono (?)</strong> - a fragment of the consciousness of Chrono King (the fourth King from [Phantasmagorian history]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mithlon/phantasmagoria/history)) that was reformed within the expanses of the Marilith's Kiss
- <strong>Magnus & Virgil Bravelight</strong> - a pair of brothers from Lux. Magnus used to be a part of the [King's Fangs]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mithlon/phantasmagoria/organizations/kings-fangs) until he resigned from his post to pursue archaeology with his brother. Virgil used to be a student at [Mathilda's Institution of Magic]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mithlon/phantasmagoria/organizations/mathildas-institution). Now he works as an affiliated researcher and he brought his brother to investigate the Kiss.
- <strong>Jack Riverdawn</strong> - used to be a guard in The Marilith's Kiss until the party convinced him to work with them to escape. At the end of it all, he returned to Aqua to live with his wife and children again.
- <strong>Kyriak</strong> - an inquisitor affiliated with the Black Mark Company that was hired directly by the [Lightwatch]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mithlon/phantasmagoria/organizations/lightwatch) to look into the reports of missing persons surrounding the Marilith's Kiss.
