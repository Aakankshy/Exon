## Summary

This short campaign followed a group of heroes that banded together to help turn the tides in what was one of the deadliest wars in Phantasmagorian history.

The battle pit the prestigious military forces of the ancient cities of Norvendom and Surrial against the desperate, cornered forces of the group that called itself The Rebellion.

The war brought with it a dreadful tide of death, pain, and misfortune yet also hope and, later, freedom. For, just as you may never possess light without shadow, to the people of what is now called [Phantasmagoria]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mith'lon/phantasmagoria), their present joy could have never been achieved without their share of hardships.

## Setting Details

The campaign took place in E4-507: before the founding of the nation known as Phantasmagoria today.

The area known as Lux today was merely a slum-like area in this year; a place where all the outcasts from the ancient cities of Norvendom and Surrial were sent to be forgotten thereafter.

These 'outcasts' band together to fight a hopeless, two-front war that they were convinced they would lose. However, through a massive stroke of luck (or good will), they managed to turn the tides and defeat both armies.

Norvendom and Surrial later dissolved due to economic crisis and those regions were split between the nation of Phantasmagoria and its neighboring countries.

## Lore
The war came to an end and the number of people that were lost were minimized thanks to the heroes. It was all very far into the past. Frankly, very few remember the heroes of the party beyond what few rumors they heard after the end of the war.

Rumors of a nameless band of ordinary heroes that had been blessed with the power to turn the tide of many of the harshest battles of the war.

## Player Characters
- <strong>Illorius “Ilo” Gwathren</strong> - he became a part of the council of [Mathilda’s Institution of Magic]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mith'lon/phantasmagoria/organizations/mathildas-institution). He has become a close family friend to the royal family in Lux and is likely one of the most revered archwizards in the region. He is close friends with Vulcan (the dragon living underneath the volcano in Ignis). He let one of his most gifted students Tuck Thimble be exiled instead of imprisoned (allowing him to flee to [Saccharo]({{ site.baseurl }}/history/past-campaigns/mariliths-kiss)). He taught Chrono (the [Fourth King]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mith'lon/phantasmagoria/history) of Phantasmagoria) the basics of Elvish swordplay that he later honed to become known for. He is 315 years old in E4-721.
- <strong>Kastral “Destiny”</strong> - she was ultimately elected as a Fate-Touched: a direct champion of [The Everkeep]({{ site.baseurl }}/history/pantheon/ancient-ones/taliama). Her very existence is on a separate flow as the endless weave of Fate. She lives a nomadic lifestyle of travel and has become some kind of an urban legend in some remote regions. She is strictly prohibited from revealing her circumstances to anybody (even if she is allowed to interact with the other members of her party that are still alive in the present). She is immortal.
- <strong>Sapphire Moon (Jade)</strong> - he finally went on the journey across the water that he had always hoped for. He found himself on Brokenskull Grave off the shore of Phantasmagoria: a pirate island. Here, he became a revered pirate/sailor. He left a legacy and a name that continues to be set as a kind of 'idol' in those circles today.
- <strong>Silent Path (Path)</strong> - she went on to live with her father (both of who gradually came to accept her brother's unfortunate fate). She spent years learning about tinkering and such with her father after that. She became a splendid hunter in tune with both the natural world as well as the ethereal one mirroring it.
- <strong>Varitothe</strong> - he returned to his life as a shepherd as the city of Lux formed following the war. He is not necessarily 'famous,' but he has a significant circle in some of the smaller circles of the city. He is a warm figure that is very well-respected in his communities and everyone knows him as the “really nice neighbor.” He is 319 years old now.

## Significant Non Player Characters
- <strong>The Second Dawn</strong> - this was a sentient magical artifact. A beautiful longsword originally crafted by [Brimgarde]({{ site.baseurl }}/history/pantheon/central-deities/brimgarde) himself. It was later blessed with sentience by Lorraine’s Wish. It  became an heirloom for the royal family of Phantasmagoria.
- <strong>Mite Tinkerbottom</strong> - grew up to be an old, scraggly man hiding out in the thick of the city of Silva. The firearm prototypes he was trying to make for the war ended up being one of the first instances of technomagical items even if he was unaware of this at the time. The firearms he made were later acquired, reverse-engineered, and repurposed for use by the [Fingers of the Fool]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/global-orgs/bmc). He remarried (after his ex-wife left to join Surrial’s forces as their tinkerer and was eventually prosecuted). Now, he lives a somewhat reclusive life (with at least 3-4 generations succeeding him).
- <strong>Tann & Degg Everworth</strong> - Degg was gravely injured in combat but both of them survived. Tann went on to develop and train a group of guards to protect the town from the wilderness. Chrono King (the fourth King from [Phantasmagorian history]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mith'lon/phantasmagoria/history)) acquired this group many years later to form the [Lightwatch]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mith'lon/phantasmagoria/organizations/lightwatch). The Everworth bloodline continued until [Creel "Ace" Everworth]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mith'lon/blionn/theq/ace).
