## The Black Mark Company

This organization is one of the most renowned Sellsword Guilds in the world today.

It mainly operates throughout Mith’lon as a group of cutthroat bounty hunters and mercenaries. Although their presence in other continents is not as prominent, they have bases and headquarters all over the world in each of the major cities and nations.

This much is common knowledge.

However, what lies behind beneath the surface of the Guild is an enigmatic council of powerful individuals known as the Fingers of the Fool. These are worshipers of Just the Fool that use the company as a cover for their underground, law enforcement operations.

Most of the Fingers are elusive; they live in the shadows and hide their identities. Others are a bit more open with the world and are known as some of the most dangerous individuals alive.

## Affiliated Characters

4. Hunter - a ferocious orcish man. Proficient with every weapon ever created and every weapon that has yet to be created, he is a cunning huntsman that is hired only to deal with the slipperiest of criminals and creatures. He has a perfect track record; he will go to any lengths to finish a job no matter what. He goes wherever the jobs take him.

7. Big Iron - an elusive but more public figure. Generally dressed to protect his true identity, the speed of his draw is unrivaled. He is based in Shamīl. <!-- [Spoilers: “he’s” actually a human woman under the mask. She has technomagical cybernetic modifications in her body (mainly her eyes and right hand) and she uses a voice modulator to scramble her voice. She operates in the Luxian branch of the BMC. Her abilities are tied to her own, innate capabilities rather than her weapons, contrary to popular belief. The technomagical elements in her body were created by an adoptive father figure in her life named Mite Tinkerbottom. He is a very old, scraggly gnomish artificer (from the Two Fronts side quest) who contributed to the Luxian Independence War after being Chosen by Lorraine’s Wish. He was one of the first to begin development of technomagical equipment even if he didn’t know it at the time. The firearms he made were later acquired, reverse-engineered, and repurposed for use by the Fingers of the Fool. He remarried (after his ex-wife left to join Surrial’s forces as their tinkerer and was eventually prosecuted) and lives a somewhat reclusive life in Silva (with at least 3-4 generations succeeding him). He was a family friend to Big Iron and took her in when her parents either died or went missing (TBD). ] -->

10. Ceredean - a human that mainly acts as the political representative for the Fingers. They are the only member that is openly known everywhere. Although their combat capabilities are limited, they possess a ferocious intuition and deal with all of the political matters for the Fingers. They mainly travel between Konex'al and Phantasmagoria but have offices reserved for them in most large nations. <!-- Spoilers: he was one of the founding members of the BMC and Fingers. He has a +7 to INT and +6 to both WIS and CHA. -->
