## The Council of Elites

A fearsome circle of archmages from all over Exon. At any given time, there are precisely 9 members in this union. Each member represents one of the schools of magic.

Over time, the representatives have changed as previous generations of practitioners have retired and given way to the newer generations.

The Protelian Union was originally formed mainly to share research and notes and such. However, as expected of a group of professional narcissists, there is not much companionship to be found other than that.

Each member and position working towards its own hidden agenda, the members only come together in the direst of times; when a threat transcends far beyond the masses... or when the other council members begin to interfere with the others' agendas.

## Members

Listed below are the current delegates of each of the schools of magic in the Protelian Union.

The identies of most of the members are hidden from the general public; only those that are in the Protelian Union or closely associated to the group know their identities.

But, even then, they generally don't know the identities of <em>all</em> of the members; just the ones that they need to.

[ <em>Dunamancy - The Keeper of Time and Space</em> ]

<strong>Current Delegate:</strong> Sumaz Despina - a young tabaxi girl from Nareeni. She’s short, wears big, round glasses, and darker brown fur. With her youth comes an intense naïvete but, at the same time, a powerful curiosity and fresh outlook on life that the other delegates don’t
She has been a member of the Union for about 19 years and, before that, there was no other delegation for the Dunamantic school of magic. Her mentor Temploc was the one that brought Dunamancy to the world and taught her everything she knows.

Neither she nor the rest are sure about what Temploc saw in her but he decided that she was the only one worthy of his legacy. Despite her perpetual feeling of being out of place, she is determined to prove herself to the other delegates and, most importantly, herself.

[ <em>Illusion - The Master of Perceived Reality</em> ]

[ <em>Necromancy - The Deathless Monarch</em> ]

<strong>Current Delegate:</strong> Devas Raventhrone - a non-binary individual. They have long, straight black hair and wear jet black robes and cloaks with hints of purple mixed in. They look slightly elvish by face but their race is indeterminable. They look youthful in comparison to many of the others but their age is indeterminable. It is unclear where they are from.

Not much is known about them even among the other delegates except for one fact: they have been in their position for its entire existence. They were a co-founder of the Protelian Union and have continued to thrive ever since using whatever kind of advanced, necromantic magic they have created over the years.

They carry themself with an air of elegance and regal importance but have quite a chaotic, nefarious side to them when it comes down to it. They have a natural affinity with The Archfright.
