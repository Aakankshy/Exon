## Description
A jovial human with a childlike curiosity and unrivaled intelligence.

He is quite young at 28 years of age but has shock white hair worn as dreads. Heâ€™s tall and lithe with a sparkle in his dark eyes. He always dresses in loose-flowing robes and baggy trousers. Definitely comfort over function.

Most of the time, he stays holed up in a tall, snow-white tower at the center of [Theq]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mith'lon/blionn/theq) that he owns with his father, <strong>Dirk Everworth</strong>.

They are quite well off thanks to money his father has earned from his work with the [Black Mark Company]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/global-orgs/bmc.md) in addition to what Creel earns from his research.

Dirk has not been around as often, recently; he was promoted to a higher station within the BMC (as an inquisitor for the Fingers of the Fool). In the interim, Creel dedicates himself to his work.

## The Ace of Blionn
Creel is a renowned mage and tinkerer in Blionn. He collaborates with many of the academic and research insitutions to push the boundaries of arcane and technological discovery.

Beside his relatively silly naming conventions and lighthearted demeanor, he contributes vast amounts of knowledge and ingenuity to the community.

One of his greatest achievements was a research paper he wrote at age 17. It proposed a revolutionary model that allowed darkly-tinted [Bramble Cores]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mith'lon/coretryss/feratos/crystal/caverns/bramble-cores.md) (which he called <strong>Null Cores</strong>) to be used for technomagical tinkering. He named the process <srtong>Null Infusion</strong>.

It was his discovery that enabled many artificers around the world to use Null Cores as a latent source of [Nix's Potentia]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mith'lon/nix.md). It was his discovery that birthed Technomagic<!--TODO--> as a whole.

This paper spread his name far and wide and 'Ace' came to be known by many other, powerful individuals across the continent and beyond. Over time, Creel reached out to a number of these individuals (to varying degrees of success).

One of his closest business relationships is with <strong>Sumaz Despina</strong> from [Nareeni]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/nareeni).

## Dark Secrets
To the average eye, Creel may present himself as a regular human. To the discerning, his biological consititution may seem too unnatural or foreign for that to be true.

The truth is that Creel is partially an illithid. His mother was orignally a human but she was captured by a group of illithids long ago. The illithids attemped to ceremorphize her but failed due to her incompatibility with the process.

She was left to exist as an amalagmation of human and monster.

Her elder brain tried to kill her for being a failed experiment but she escaped back to the surface with most of her memories as a human gone. She reexperienced the world through the eyes of this new kind of creature.

An illithid search party eventually found her many years later but she was saved by her to-be-husband, Dirk, who was helping her survive on the surface. They eloped after the fight and hid in Blionn.

For many years, she tried to sustain herself on non-humanoid brains and Dirk would help get them for her through his work as a hunter for the BMC. During these years, she had and gave birth to Creel.

When Creel was still young, his mother killed herself after beginning to lose herself to her monstrous side. It seemed to be gradually taking over her body until she began feeling a horrific the urge to consume Dirk and even Creel.

Dirk took time off his work to care for Creel until he came of age. Perhaps due to his otherworldy lineage, Creel matured quickly and seemed to be blessed with an immense intellect. The same intellect that turned the simple boy with a tragic past into <em>Ace</em>.
