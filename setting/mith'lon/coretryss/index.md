- like an icy junkertown
- there is a huge crater at the epicenter
- there are large spires of icy shards jutting out of the ground all around the crater
- they spend most of their days going to a large, crystalline spire standing tall in the center of the crater (mostly empty; nothing a the top)
  - the surrounding spires reflect Nix's Potentia (radiation) to the center spire which internally reflects all of it and concentrates it into the ground
  - the concentrated Potentia has created a sort of blight in the region that manifests as unnaturally aggressive monsters
- the communities built around this area are very steampunk
- you go into the spire at the base and drop down into a labrynthine structure; a dungeon
- there are countless floors each infested by an unnatural number of monsters that appear endlessly
- the creatures within get progressively more intense the lower you go
- each creature has a "bramble core" within; a rough gemlike stone that is used for arcane and technological tinkering; it works like a power cell of sorts
  - the bramble cores near the surface are basically clear; they don't have as much of the Potentia captured within them so they are basically "empty"
  - at VERY low floors, you discover cores that have a progressively darker purple coloration to them
  - the dark purple ones have more and more of this Potentia stored within
  - for simple arcane constructs, they are useless; the cores suck up arcane energy placed within much like Nix
  - however, for technomagical constructs, they are priceless; turns out that storing a "dearth" of energy in these cores allows you to harness Nix's Potentia
    - when the cores are given arcane power, the bramble cores release bursts of Potentia
      - this can either be done manually by spellcasters or by using a dark core in tandem with a charged light core
    - the resultant Potentia can then be used to power technomagical constructs
    - this process is called Null Infusion
      - the Ace of Blionn was the one that invented this and gave these darker cores their astounding price
