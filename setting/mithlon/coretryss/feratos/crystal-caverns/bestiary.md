<!--

brainstorm:
- dead creatures within the caverns are corrupted into undead
  - fatally wounded creatures could have a chance of being diseased or debuffed in a similar way

- all other creatures form unnaturally. They don't reproduce; they "manifest" as tangible embodiments of the bramble cores' energy
- they all (regardless of intelligence) ultimately feel like husks; like hollow forms being puppeteered by the cores

common types
- aberrations
- monstrosities
- undead
- oozes
- elementals (some)
  - one specific (special) type could be "light elementals" of some kind; they are reflections of other non-elemental creatures but they form as these translucent and glowy entities
    - they have abilities that specifically emulate the bramble cores' powers
