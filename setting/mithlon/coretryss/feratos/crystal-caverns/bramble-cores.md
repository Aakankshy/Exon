## Nature's Bounty
Bramble Cores are a highly potent magical resource specific to the region of Coretryss.

They are sharp, rough, gem-like stones that are generally clear. When held under a light, some cores slightly glow a light shade of purple.

Bramble Cores are attained within the Crystal Caverns. Some can be mined from large deposits along the walls of the caverns. However, most are collected by harvesting the bodies of dead monsters within.

## Life in the Caves
There are a plethora of creatures that can be found within the Crystal Caverns. The one thing these creatures all have in common is their unnatural aggression and the Bramble Cores that can be found within their bodies.

Some monsters contain negligible quantities of the Cores within them. Others, however, can yield 1-2 sizable shards of them.

Life in the cave is created at an alarmingly rapid rate. It is theorized that there is an unknown force within the caverns that is artifically producing it.

And these Bramble Cores are key to sustaining it.

## Powering the Arcane World
Bramble Cores are primarily used for arcane and technological innovation. They are an integral part of modern-day artificing.

Bramble Cores have the capacity to be infused with large amounts of arcane energy. They then store this energy until released. In large amounts, Bramble Cores can power just about anything.

As such, students of the arcane artificing arts that have access to the Cores are able to create more complex products.

Bramble Cores are judged on purity; the clearer the Core, the more arcane energy it can store. On the lower floors, Cores tend to be much darker and are less effective at storing arcane energy.

For many years, traversing to lower floors was considered pointless. That was until the discovery of <strong>Null Infusion</strong>.

## Null Infusion
In E4-710, a researcher named [Creel Everworth]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mith'lon/blionn/theq/ace.md) made a revolutionary discovery.

Bramble Cores with darker purple colorations (which he referred to as <strong>Null Cores</strong>) turned out to be more than they seemed. He determined that Null Cores contained high concentrations of the same force that sustains [Nix]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/nix.md).

This dark purple matter within displayed similar properties to the celestial body; when supplied with regular arcane energy, it would be consumed and large amounts of <em>Potentia</em><!--TODO--> would be released.

This Potentia could then be used to power technomagical constructs. This was the missing link between Potentia and technomagic as a whole. Immediately, the price of these 'Null Cores' skyrocketed as the highest mages and artificers began seeking them.

As the demand for them increased, so did the frequency of deeper traversals of the Crystal Caves by the adventurers of Feratos.

## Luxury in Abundance
While most physical deposits of Bramble Cores on higher floors have been mined up already, there is no end to them.

On most days, adventurers from all over Feratos delve into the dungeon to harvest Bramble Cores. They submit these cores to the [Rubus Union]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mith'lon/coretryss/organizations/rubus-union) for gold.

While there is no shortage for Bramble Cores within Coretryss, the same cannot be said for the rest of the world.

Coretryss is the only place where Bramble Cores are found. Many of Coretryss' close trade partners pay the settlement with large amounts of money and resources to sustain it.
