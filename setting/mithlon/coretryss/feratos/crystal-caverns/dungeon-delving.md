<!--

gist:
- party members roll 1d4 to see how many floors they traverse
- then they roll 1d100 or 1d200 to choose a random encounter
  - examples:
  - you have to sneak past some dormant monsters or get into a fight
  - the next few floors are empty; you can double your roll
  - you find a cluster of cores; you can spend 10 mins to collect
  - you encounter a mini-boss encounter
  - you find a floor that you can rest in if you want
  - you have to do a puzzle
  - etc.
