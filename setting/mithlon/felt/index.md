## Overview

<strong>Felt</strong> is an archipelago to the Northeast of the continent of [Mith'lon]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mithlon). Its barren, freezing confines harbor a simple and unruly society.

Semi-subterranean structures are scattered among the roaring winds. Long, snaking trenches are dug into the rolling hills of snow. Wanderers, hunters, blizzard-surfers, and the odd vigilante roam this chilling, ever-shrouded expanse.

<strong>Population:</strong> \~2500 (47% Dwarves, 23% Humans, 11% Goliaths, 19% other races)

<strong>Government:</strong> Most cities and towns govern themselves. By delegated mayors, bandit groups, corrupt aristocrats, and the like. But in the vacant, open fields, law is something known only by nature.

<strong>Defense:</strong> The need for protection is scarce due to the extreme climate conditions. Frozen waters barring most kinds of naval travel. Violent winds kicking up snow and making it impossible to see. Larger cities sometimes delegate town sheriffs or hire mercenaries to maintain the peace.

<strong>Commerce:</strong> The frozen waters throughout the Greater Feltian Region limit Felt's trading capacity greatly. The country's primary export is a special material unique to it known as [<strong>cracklite</strong>]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mithlon/felt/cracklite): a shimmering crystal found in the mines of [K'alista]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mithlon/felt/kalista). Their biggest imports are fabrics, oil, and fish.

<strong>[Organizations]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mithlon/felt/organizations):</strong> While Felt is mostly composed of unaffiliated persons, there are a few underlying factions dominating the scene:

- [<strong>Knights of Gale</strong>]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mithlon/felt/organizations/knights-of-gale)
- [<strong>The Wintry Devils</strong>]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mithlon/felt/organizations/wintry-devils)
- [<strong>The Feltian Research & Innovation Society</strong>]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mithlon/felt/organizations/fris)
- [<strong>The Nilya Guild</strong>]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mithlon/felt/organizations/nilya-guild)
- [<strong>The Snoffgott Network</strong>]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mithlon/felt/organizations/snoffgott-network)

## Religion
In general, the worship of deities in Felt is scarce.

The only churches take the form of much smaller, understaffed structures built at the edges of larger cities. They are dedicated to a variety of deities such as [Mercatia]({{ site.baseurl }}/history/pantheon/central-deities/mercatia), [Amarak]({{ site.baseurl }}/history/pantheon/central-deities/amarak), and [Nexor]({{ site.baseurl }}/history/pantheon/central-deities/nexor).

Instead, the people of Felt have come to personify nature as their primary entity of worship. They refer to this entity as, <strong>Ufturunn</strong> which literally translates to "the fury of the land".

Common prayers include (translated):

- "O Ufturunn, grant me passage." - used by travelers and some surfers
- "To be gifted the boon of Ufturunn's sight." - used when visibility is low
- "Please watch over this humble challenger, O Furious One." - most common prayer for surfers and hunters (especially of deadly creatures)

## Geography
The archipelago is comprised of five major islands: <strong>Terrig</strong>, <strong>K'alista</strong>, <strong>Krea</strong>, <strong>Hel</strong>, and <strong>Pon</strong>.

There are dozens of other, smaller islands forming it. However, there are no exact records of exactly how many there are; the climate in Felt is not friendly to cartographers.

## Climate
The Greater Feltian Region refers to the archipelago and a large portion of the water surrounding it (mainly farther to the North and East). This region is highly-prone to blizzards and snowstorms alike.

The region experiences subzero temperatures throughout the year. The ocean surface surrounding most islands lies frozen; naval travel to and from the region is dangerous and difficult.

## Transport
Naval travel in nearly impossible in the Northeastern sections of the Greater Feltian Region; the waters are frozen and turbulent otherwise. On top of this, there is low visibility and safety due to the constant winds.

Over time, the people of Felt had to create new ways to transport goods between its islands. Today, the most commonly used mode of transportation are "<strong>Sleds</strong>".

These are large rectangular platforms made generally of wood. Many thin and narrow metallic blades extend out from below them and into the ice that allow for unidirectional movement.

These Sleds carry supplies and sometimes even people between islands.

And the ones that pull them are called "[<strong>Blizzard Surfers</strong>]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mithlon/felt/blizzard-surfing)." 

## Trade
The extreme climate in the Greater Feltian Region constricts most of its trade to the <strong>Nilya Channel</strong> in the Southwest.

Felt's primary trading partner is [Allitrea]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mithlon/allitrea): the nation on the other end of the Nilya Channel. This country plays a huge role in a lot of trade in the Northeastern areas of Mith'lon.

In exchange for being the biggest recipient of Felt's cracklite, they provide Felt with goods that they receive from the South.
