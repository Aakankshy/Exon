## A Shimmering Landscape
K'alista is home to the largest deposits of cracklite in Felt. Over time, the winds have whittled the surface deposits of these crystals and carried the remaining, glittering dust of violets and pinks all over.

Now, the horizon shimmers as far as eyes can see.

Most inhabitants of this island are miners, bandits, and outcasts.

The miners often spend their day in K'alista and then leave to return to [Terrig]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mithlon/felt/terrig) by the evening. There are some that choose to remain and avoid traveling and its dangers as much as possible.

Rumors suggest that many of the bandits affiliated with independent groups as well as the [Wintry Devils]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mithlon/felt/organizations/wintry-devils) hide out somewhere amidst its sparkling winds.
