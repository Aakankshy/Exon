## The Feltian Research & Innovation Society
This group of researchers were sent from [Blionn]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mithlon/blionn) only a few years ago. There are approximately 100 of them.

The original intention was to have these researchers directly study the applications of [cracklite]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mithlon/felt/cracklite). They spent a year or so optimizing its use as a magically-incandescent light source.

However, after a number of accidents with this volatile and dangerous substance, their research began to extend to other applications.

One of the prime examples being magical weaponry.

## A Deal with the Devils
As their research of magical weaponry progressed, the FRIS (pronounced "Ferris") eventually began to share their creations with the people of Felt.

At first, it was just to peacekeepers (such as the [Knights of Gale]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mithlon/felt/organizations/knights-of-gale)). Eventually, it was to whoever could pay the greatest price for them.

Wanderers, smaller mercenary groups, goliath communities, and, according to anonymous sources, perhaps even bandits from the [Wintry Devils]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mithlon/felt/organizations/wintry-devils).

## The Ten Scholars
The FRIS was mostly composed of less-skilled artificers, wizards, and mages; they were the most "expendable" researchers that Blionn to send.

However, they needed at least a few that they could trust. They appointed ten team leaders to send alongside the group. Each would be in charge of a few of their own researchers.

The Ten Scholars congregate once every month to have a discussion regarding progress and decisions for the future of their research.

A number of these were against the research of cracklite weapons. However, it appealed to enough of them to ultimately pass this decision.

It is believed that many of them have started making back-alley deals with local factions to ensure profits. It's almost as if the original purpose of their work is no longer a concern.
