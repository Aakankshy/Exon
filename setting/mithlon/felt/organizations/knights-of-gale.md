## Wherever the Wind Blows
The Knights of Gale are a band of mercenaries based primarily in Terrig. The members of this group were originally a part of the Feltian branch of the [Black Mark Company]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/global-orgs/bmc) which was later disbanded.

Left jobless, they offered their services to the local Feltian people. Now, their skills are a valued asset throughout the nation.

Town mayors hire them as peacekeepers for their towns; traders hire them to fend off against wandering bandits; those very bandits hire them to add more muscle to their ranks.

## Notable Members
- **Sheljeer** - A silver dragonborn woman from [Konex'al]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/konexal)<!--TODO-->. She was one of the first BMC mercenaries sent to Felt. Over time, she climbed the ranks to become an officer of sorts for the branch. After the disbandment, she became the peacekeeper in charge for [Stelfoss]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mithlon/felt/terrig/stelfoss). Her goal is to simply maintain some semblance of peace in the otherwise lawless town.
