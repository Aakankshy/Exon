## The Icy Veins of Felt
International trade for Felt is scarce. The Nilya Guild has been maintaining trade across the Nilya Channel consistent and prosperous for years.

This guild exports the [cracklite]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mithlon/felt/cracklite) mined in [K'alista]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mithlon/felt/kalista) and imports goods from the neighboring nation of [Allitrea]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mithlon/allitrea).

Most of their offices and workers are stationed in Pon but they have some smaller outposts on other islands (like the aforementioned K'alista) that ensure the consistent flow of goods.

## Notable Members
- **Brughek Tarrythorn** - An older, dwarvish man from Terrig. He has been the harbormaster in Pon for most of his life. He is a respected figure in the area and very hardworking.
