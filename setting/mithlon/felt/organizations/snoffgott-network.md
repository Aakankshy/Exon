## Disconnections Connected
Traversal across the Greater Feltian Region is difficult. The waters are frozen and the storms are intense.

The Snoffgott Network (literal translation: "marching through the storm") was the guild formed when [blizzard surfing]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mithlon/felt/blizzard-surfing) started gaining recognition as an effective method of traversal in the region.

Today, they manage the network of all the official trading routes spread throughout Felt. They offer Sleds and surfers and mercenary escorts for high-value goods.

## The Snow Divers
The Snoffgott Network has a number of elite blizzard surfers affiliated with their guild.

Blizzard surfing is a dangerous and possibly unreliable mode of transportation. The Snow Divers were assembled by the Snoffgott Network to create trust and a more effective network of these surfers.

The Snoffgott Network pays to train these surfers, keep them safe, and, perhaps most importantly, advertise their skills.

There are a few dozens of these surfers. As the demand for their services has risen over time, they practically live the luxurious lives of celebrities.

## A Powerful Monopoly
With how popular blizzard surfing has become, the Snoffgott Network's renown has only grown over time. It requires highly-specialized, skilled individuals and the consequences of failure are immense.

With most of the most famous and trusted blizzard surfers in the hands of the Snoffgott Network, they have grown quite monopolistic in the region.

However, many merchants agree that, despite this, the Snoffgott Network has been honest with their prices and kept them consistent over the years. To what degree that is true behind the scenes, however, is unknown.
