## A Devilish Tyranny
The Wintry Devils are an elusive group of thieves, criminals, killers, and other scoundrels. They steal, pillage, and exploit all over the Greater Feltian Region.

Forming this group allows them to collaboratively remain in a position of power in this region. Records suggest that they control some large portions of the cracklite mining industry.

To the common citizen of Felt, however, they are simply dangerous--a force to be feared and avoided no matter what.

## Notable Members
Most known members of the Wintry Devils are no-name bandits. The ones that are truly in power are hidden away. Not much is known about them besides their overwhelming influence and tyrannical ambitions.
