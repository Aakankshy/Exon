## Barren & Deadly
Compared to the other islands of Felt, Terrig is quite a bit more hospitable. While this may give the false impression that this makes it a safer place, to the experienced eye, this could not be farther from the truth.

Alongside the Feltian people, Terrig is home to more arctic creatures in general. Large, terrible beasts that prey upon travelers. It is because of this that the need for hired mercenaries is much greater than the other islands.

Despite this, most of the Feltian people reside in Terrig; ultimately, it <em>is</em> the most inhabitable island of them all.
