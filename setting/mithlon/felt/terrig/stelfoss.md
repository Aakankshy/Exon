## The Wild East
**Population:** <1000

Located north of the core of [Terrig]({ site.baseurl }}/setting/mithlon/felt/terrig), Stelfoss is very much the heart of the entire nation of Felt. Despite being quite a small town, the people within it are what define its worth.

Leaders and officers from the largest factions in the region conspire in dingy, underground taverns. Wandering bounty hunters pass through its winding trenches as they look for their next marks. Merchants strike back alley deals to make a quick buck before skipping town. Bandits rough up the locals to maintain their fearful image.

Stelfoss is very much a town made by scoundrels for scoundrels. A cutthroat community basking in the stressful and wild environment of the Greater Feltian Region.

The town mayor is in charge of the town's neighboring trade routes courtesy of the [Snoffgott Network]({ site.baseurl }}/setting/mithlon/felt/organizations/snoffgott-network). This puts the town in control of a large amount of the cracklite mined in [K'alista]({ site.baseurl }}/setting/mithlon/felt/kalista) and brought over the **Glacial Duct**.

## Places of Interest
- **Glacial Duct** - the bridge a few miles to the north of Stelfoss connecting K'alista and Terrig to one another.
- **The Fossian Valley** - a large trench perhaps 20 feet deep that runs through the heart of Stelfoss. Most large establishments can be found built into its walls. Almost all other trenches in the city have been connected to it over time.
- **Trader's Tomb** - a multi-level underground inn in the Fossian Valley. It has a popular tavern on the first floor and rooms underneath. It's mostly a modest place but there are some finer living spaces reserved on the lower floors.
- **Snowy's Goods & Services** - a general store in the Fossian Valley run by a cheery young harengon. Rumors say that she has a second floor hidden away where she hides legally questionable goods and materials.
- **Shrine of Ufturunn** - a shrine dedicated to Ufturunn built on the outskirts of Stelfoss. It is quite small but diligently maintained by its few acolytes.

## Notable Figures
- **Duregg Hawthorne** - a gentle dwarvish man in his early hundreds appointed as the mayor of this Stelfoss. He took over after the previous mayor (his mother) passed away. The community is very trusting of him and he is a fairly well-respected leader.
- **Sheljeer** - the town's peacekeeper in charge. She is an important figure among the [Knights of Gale]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mithlon/felt/organizations/knights-of-gale). More details there.
