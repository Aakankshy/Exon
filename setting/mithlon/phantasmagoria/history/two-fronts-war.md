## Light from Darkness
The Two Fronts war began in E4-501 and lasted for 6 long years. Thousands of lives were lost; homes were destroyed; tears were shed.

But at its core, the Two Fronts war was a battle for independence. Salvation. In its wake, beyond the settling chaos was hope and a new beginning. [Lux]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mithlon/phantasmagoria/lux).

The battle took place between a haphazard group that called itself <em>'The Rebellion'</em> and the combined military forces of <strong>Norvendom</strong> and <strong>Surrial</strong>.

The war was one-sided and hopeless for the majority of its duration. However, through an unexpected stroke of luck, The Rebellion turned the tides and defeated their oppressors against all odds.

## Superpowers of the Past
Both Norvendom and Surrial were nations at the time of the war that were later dissolved in the century that followed it.

They were two of the mightiest superpowers in Exon.

Norvendom was at the forefront of magical and technological research. They had some of the most prestigious and advanced academic and research institutions in the world.

Meanwhile, Surrial controlled one of the largest portions of Mith'lon. Their military was unrivaled both in numbers and power. Thanks to their access to an abundance of both oil and spice, they were one of the richest nations in the world too.

## No Man's Land
Both the governing body of Norvendom and royal family of Surrial were obsessed with creating perfect societies. While all nations were striving for this goal around this point in history, Norvendom and Surrial were the most notorious examples.

This obsession with creating 'utopia' formed what was known as the '<em>Hospitable Society Agreement</em>.'

On the surface, this agreement was signed by both nations as a means of improving the welfare of their respective societies.

However, this was achieved by designating an area on their shared border where they would send their 'unwanted' citizens. People with disabilities. People of specific races. People coming from specific backgrounds.

Slowly and quietly, this space began to turn into a slum-like space colloquially known as 'No Man's Land.' An unlivable, barren, deserted land full of people that had been exiled from their homes because they 'threatened' their nations by simply existing.

Famine. Disease. Death. These dark notions became normalized for them. The times were dire and, over time, the number of people living in No Man's Land only ever increased.

Following the end to the Mith'lon War<!--TODO--> in E4-<!--TODO-->, both Norvendom and Surrial were in tight positions. Their defensive capabilities were limited and their funds were running dry.

It was around this time that The Rebellion formed.

## Dario
It began with a man named <strong>Dario</strong>.

He was a noble, glorious individual that was born in No Man's Land. He and his younger sister <strong>Lorraine</strong> lost their parents at a very young age to disease.

They also had a brother named <strong>Chain</strong>. Records suggest that he was not their brother by blood but choice.

In E4-507 (at the end of the war), Dario would come to be known as the First King of Phantasmagoria and Chain its second.

As tensions were at an all time high, it was Dario alongside some others that rose up that convinced the Rebels to band together. Both neighboring nations were exhausted. If there was ever going to be a time to make a stand, it was right then.

Despite knowing that it was going to be a war on two fronts between two of the most powerful military entities in the world and a group of nobodies, The Rebellion rose.

And The Rebellion was angry.

## Lorraine's Wish
5 years passed. The fight was intense and, slowly, The Rebellion was being snuffed out. Their knowledge of the terrain and cunning was the only thing letting them hang on.

It was around this time that Lorraine was fell ill. She displayed similar symptoms to Dario's mother right as she passed. In a few months, with her condition worsening, it was clear that there was no saving her.

As a bruised Dario, Chain, and group of trusted allies huddled near the tent in the rain, Lorraine spoke her final words.

Words that wished for the welfare of not just herself or her brothers but The Rebellion as a whole. Words that wished for a world where its citizens were free to feel and think however and whatever they wanted.

Words that wished for a world without the pain they constantly endured in their childhood. A world where The Rebellion could succeed in moving towards that kind of a place.

And as she breathed her final breath, she released an inexplicable surge of powerful magical energy. At this moment, in what felt like just a saddening wish of a dying child, Dario, Chain and the others watched as several of their soldiers were consumed by a plume of arcane energy.

Energy that healed the wounded and emboldened the weakened. This moment is now referred to as <strong>Lorraine's Wish</strong>.

Researchers at [Mathilda's Institution of Magic]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mithlon/phantasmagoria/organizations/mathildas-institution) later analyzed the residual magic energy and determined it to be akin to a Wish spell.

Whatever it was, this was the turning point for this war. The point after which The Rebellion finally stood a chance.

## The Chosen Few
Lorraine's Wish imbued a select number of Rebels with a fearsome power. These Rebels were appropriately given the title <strong>The Chosen Few</strong>.

Even a single one of these Chosen Few could battle a hundred soldiers on their own or empower a hundred others to fight gloriously. Dario fought alongside Chain to preserve their sister's dream (both of which had been blessed by the Wish).

## The Final Stand
Through sheer will and with the help of their new powers, the Rebels won the battle at both fronts. But, in the end, Dario was killed in battle. It was then that he passed the mantle off to Chain.

Chain continued to carry on the legacy of both of his siblings. When he was officially elected by the people as the King of their new nation, he insisted to be called the <em>Second King</em>; he felt Dario was the only one that could live up to the title of the <em>First King</em>.

<em>( Note: there was a short campaign run that was set near the end of the Two Fronts war with more details about how the war went. More information [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/history/past-campaigns/two-fronts); however, as with the records of all [past campaigns]({{ site.baseurl }}/history/past-campaigns) in this Archive, how many of the details are to be considered canonical are up to the individual. )</em>

## Aftermath
The end of this war marked a new, humble beginning for the people of No Man's Land.

Or, more accurately, the city of <strong>Lux</strong>.

The citizens of this brand new city secured a large portion of the territory previously under the control of their oppressors. They lived a simple, nomadic life for a time as they slowly began to build the city from the ground up.

Eventually, both Norvendom and Surrial collapsed due to severe economic and political strife. This gave way to the expansion of the nation now known as Phantasmagoria.

The remaining land of Norvendom reformed under new political control as [Blionn]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mithlon/blionn).

Surrial was eventually absorbed by the emerging world power [Nareeni]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mithlon/nareeni) following their liberation from colonization.
