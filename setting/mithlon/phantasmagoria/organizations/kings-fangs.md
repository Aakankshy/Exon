## The Royal Sentinels
The King's Fangs are an elite subgroup within the Lightwatch. The King’s Fangs are comprised of 16 remarkable individuals.

They are recognized by the Royal Family as the best of the best and are given charge of graver responsibilities such as acting as personal guards to the Royal family and such.

They are all generally warriors but there are a couple of exceptions to this...

## Background
The King’s Fangs have but one goal: to maintain peace in the city. They are, as a result, antagonistic to the [Red Hoods]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mithlon/phantasmagoria/organizations/red-hoods) as well as all other groups threatening the city's peace.

The Fangs answer directly to the King and often act as the intermediaries the Royal family and the Lightwatch; they pass orders from the top of the chain of command down to them.

## Notable Members
- <strong>Vilkane “Battlegod” Rathfelltapp</strong>

A massive goliath woman that is both a deadly warrior and cunning strategist. She is the acting master of The King’s Fangs as the second-in-command after the King.

Vilkane takes care of all political affairs, strategy, and orders that concern the other King’s Fangs and Lightwatch. Her grandmother was one of the Chosen Few in the [Two Front war]({{ site.baseurl }}/setting/mithlon/phantasmagoria/history/two-fronts-war) and that same, enchanted blood runs through the fearsome "Battlegod".

She consistently displays unceasing diligence to her work and training, and has shown time and time again that she is capable when the city was in peril.
