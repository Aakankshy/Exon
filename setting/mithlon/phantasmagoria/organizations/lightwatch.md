## Guardians of the Light
The Lightwatch serves as the main guarding force in Lux: the capital of Phantasmagoria. It is also the group that undergoes military training to respond to potential threats.

However, with its geographically advantageous location as a crucial ally for trade, Phantasmagoria has mostly had a positive relationship with other nations and rarely gone to war proper.

The Lightwatch guards are comprised of a number of races but the ones in power tend to be humans. They take care of general law enforcement affairs around the capital with as much impartiality as possible.

## Background
The Lightwatch directly answers to the royal family. They are also funded primarily by the family but also through general taxation on the citizens of Lux.

The Lightwatch guards take care of small to medium-sized law enforcement matters around the city (and occasionally outside in other cities if they ever enlist Lux's help).

They have a number of posts around the city but their main headquarters are near the center of the city's Inner Ring: it is a beautiful multi-story building called, <strong>The Luxian Beacon</strong> that is primarily decorated in ornate whites and golds.
