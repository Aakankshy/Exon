## Coalition of Evil
The Red Hoods are a group of cultists operating in and near the capital city of Phantasmagoria: Lux.

They only loosely existed for a number of years until Gerald took the throne. It was his humanitarian effort to help non-humans in the nation that really solidified the group.

The Red Hoods believe that Lux is meant to be a ‘pure city’ and that the existence of non-humans detract from that ideal.

A few years ago, their actions only went so far as occasional rallies and protests. Recently, however, they have been rumored to attack non-humans around the city in the dead of the night, cause havoc in the day from the shadows, and generally contribute to the city's societal instability.

Their ranks primarily consist of worshipers of both [Nalastzar]({{ site.baseurl }}/history/pantheon/central-deities/nalastzar) (the Unseen Tyrant) and [Mercatia]({{ site.baseurl }}/history/pantheon/central-deities/mercatia) (the Invisible Hand).

Each member always carries some kind of red cloth on them at all times. Many wear crimson cloaks but, in an effort to remain inconspicuous, they often carry red handkerchiefs or bandannas or shawls and such.

## Background
The Red Hoods are split into two factions: the Lower and Upper Echelons.

The Lower Echelon is a more eclectic group of all those who agree with the Red Hoods’ cause. They are the ones that operate in Lux on a daily basis and generally remain undercover as they spread their beliefs.

The Upper Echelon is more elusive. Many of the low-ranking members of the Lower Echelon don’t even realize that this section of the organization exists.

Many of the members of the Upper Echelon are those that have been selected for their abilities and, ironically, this means that there are some non-humans mixed in as well.

While the organization is not entirely accepting of this, Akazu believes that it’s for the greater good.

The Upper Echelon operates in an underground, labyrinthine base beneath the Forest City of Silva. Within, it researches dark, sanctioned magic that could be used to accomplish their goals. They specialize in illusory magic, mainly.

## The Vault of Mist

The labyrinth they occupy is colloquially known (by the Silvan natives) as the <em>Vault of Mist</em>.

This is because the spaces surrounding the entrances on the surface are surrounded by a deadly, illusory mist. Rumor has it that those who walk into the mist never leave.

To the average citizen, the Vault's existence itself is a questionable fact. All this is thanks to a number of mages from the Upper Echelon that work tirelessly to maintain a powerful, illusory barrier around their headquarters.

The illusion gradually rotates the space above the labyrinth in circles and causes those walking through it to unknowingly go around in circles forever.

## Notable Members
- <strong>Akazu</strong>

A human girl with a very soft, cute look to her on the surface.

She happens to be one of the most nefarious people in the country as well as the ringleader of the Red Hoods. Her name (which is a pseudonym) is a symbol of fear as it represents the very person that first pushed the idea of “cleansing the nation of all impurities”.

To be more accurate, her grandmother was the one that informally created the Red Hoods a number of years ago. Akazu killed her only recently to take power (as well as her grandmother's pseudonym) and also because she just didn't like her very much.

- <strong>Mahou</strong>

An elven man whose existence is hidden from the outside world. His name is also a pseudonym.

Mahou is the one in charge of the Upper Echelon. He’s a bit older and lanky and very cunning. Although he collaborates with Akazu directly, Akazu is still considered to be above him politically.

This is something that he really does not like.

He is a master in illusory magic and very adept in magic as a whole; he was initially a student in Mathilda’s Institution of Magic but he was later expelled for beginning to dabble in 'prohibited practices.'

Working with the Red Hoods is his way of enacting revenge on those who wronged him.
