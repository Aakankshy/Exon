## Hidden in Plain Sight
The Shadowprowlers are a thieves’ guild that operate within the shadows of the Luxian Outer Ring.

It is unknown how long this organization has been among the Luxian ranks but, in recent years, their existence has become one that incites fear in every citizen of the nation's capital.

The members of the organization (<em>Prowlers</em>) hide out across numerous establishments in the Outer Ring.

Many also take to the sewers; with how the city is structured (where the Inner Ring rises farther above the Outer Ring as one travels deeper into the city) the Outer Ring possesses an abundance of access points into this system.

The Shadowprowlers have an alleged tendency to target richer individuals in the Inner Ring of the city and redistribute that money to themselves and their guild. Their image is often associated with greed, as a result.

## Background
Most of the Prowlers are either those that have lived and grown in the Outer Ring or select residents of the Inner Ring that identify more closely with the Shadowprowlers than their own communities.

The Prowlers generally set their eyes on doing work akin to vigilantism; they take from the rich and give to the poor (which just happens to be their own, most often).

Although the rumors about this are true, what is omitted is their reluctance in the matter; they are an organization that operates out of desperation rather than malice.

Despite other rumors, the Shadowprowlers are generally opposed to the Red Hoods; most of the demographics that the Red Hoods discriminate against are the ones that the Shadowprowlers are comprised of.

In addition, while the Red Hoods target a wider range of people based on background and ethnicity, the Shadowprowlers determine their targets solely based on wealth. This is something that both organizations disagree on.

## Notable Members
- <strong>Witty</strong>

A young, tiefling boy no more than maybe 15 years old. He has shadowy gray skin and black eyes.

Despite his age, he has been a deeply-respected member of the Outer Ring for his whole life. His parents were killed by some Inner Ring bigots (simply for being tieflings) and Witty was thrown to the wolves right from the beginning.

But, gifted with a keen intellect, he worked his way around the neighborhood and quickly became one of the highest ranking members of the Shadowprowlers in a matter of 3 years.

There was resistance to ‘letting a kid call the shots’ but his wisdom has gotten the Shadowprowlers through a lot. His results are undeniable.

While he may not be unanimously appreciated but most of the Outer Ring dwellers go directly to him when they need help.

- <strong>Burlap Tinbucket</strong>

A dwarvish man that is another respected member of the community.

While he is not officially a member of the Shadowprowlers (as per his own wishes to avoid trouble), he plays a key part in the organization. He acts as a supporting pillar to the organization as well as an access point into their guild.

His smithy (a somewhat ramshackle establishment called <em>The Tin Bucket</em>) has a hidden entrance point to the sewer system in a back room. What used to be a toilet in his building was broken down to make storage space for his business and he never patched the hole up.

In addition to keeping watch over this entrance point, he also does the majority of the smithing work for the Prowlers' equipment.

Some of his duties include repair work, making basic weapons and armor for new recruits, and so on. Contrary to the outward appearance of his smithy, he’s quite a skilled blacksmith.
